Maven
    artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it, then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar, you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed. eg. maven, commons-math
    groupId uniquely identifies your project across all projects. A group ID should follow Java's package name rules. This means it starts with a reversed domain name you control. For example, org.apache.maven, org.apache.commonss
