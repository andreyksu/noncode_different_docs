In Java generics, the concept of recursive type bounds allows you to define a type parameter that is constrained to be a subtype of a certain type, which itself is parameterized by the same type parameter. This can lead to a form of self-referential type definitions, which can be useful in certain design patterns, particularly in fluent interfaces and builder patterns.

### Understanding Recursive Type Bounds

The syntax `T extends SomeType<T>` indicates that `T` is a type parameter that must extend `SomeType`, where `SomeType` is also parameterized by `T`. This creates a recursive relationship between the type parameter and the type it extends.

#### Example of Recursive Type Bounds

Let's look at a simple example to illustrate this concept:

```java
// A generic interface with a recursive type bound
interface MyGenericInterface<T extends MyGenericInterface<T>> {
    T doSomething();
}

// A concrete implementation of the interface
class MyConcreteClass implements MyGenericInterface<MyConcreteClass> {
    @Override
    public MyConcreteClass doSomething() {
        // Implementation here
        System.out.println("Doing something in MyConcreteClass");
        return this;
    }
}

// Another concrete implementation
class AnotherConcreteClass implements MyGenericInterface<AnotherConcreteClass> {
    @Override
    public AnotherConcreteClass doSomething() {
        // Implementation here
        System.out.println("Doing something in AnotherConcreteClass");
        return this;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyConcreteClass myConcrete = new MyConcreteClass();
        myConcrete.doSomething();

        AnotherConcreteClass anotherConcrete = new AnotherConcreteClass();
        anotherConcrete.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Generic Interface**: The interface `MyGenericInterface<T extends MyGenericInterface<T>>` defines a method `doSomething()` that returns an instance of type `T`. This means that any class implementing this interface must specify itself as the type parameter.

2. **Concrete Implementations**: 
   - `MyConcreteClass` implements `MyGenericInterface<MyConcreteClass>`, meaning it specifies itself as the type parameter. The `doSomething()` method returns an instance of `MyConcreteClass`.
   - `AnotherConcreteClass` does the same for its own type.

3. **Fluent Interface**: This pattern allows for a fluent interface, where methods can return the same type as the implementing class. This is particularly useful in builder patterns or when chaining method calls.

### Unbounded Recursion

The term "unbounded recursion" in the context of generics can be misleading. The recursive type bound `T extends SomeType<T>` does not create an infinite loop or recursion in the traditional sense. Instead, it establishes a relationship where `T` is constrained to be a specific type that adheres(придерживаться) to the structure defined by `SomeType`.

### Limitations and Considerations

1. **Type Safety**: This pattern ensures type safety, as the compiler can enforce that the methods return the correct type.

2. **Complexity**: While recursive type bounds can be powerful, they can also make the code more complex and harder to understand. It's essential to use them judiciously.

3. **Use Cases**: Common use cases for this pattern include:
   - Fluent interfaces (e.g., builders).
   - Type-safe hierarchies where subclasses need to return their own type.

### Summary

In summary, the expression `T extends SomeType<T>` in Java generics allows for the creation of recursive type bounds, enabling a type parameter to refer to itself in a constrained manner. This pattern is useful for creating fluent interfaces and ensuring type safety in method return types. While it can add complexity, it provides a powerful tool for designing flexible and type-safe APIs.
