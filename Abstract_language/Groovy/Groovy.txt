When a closure is the last parameter of a method call, like when using Groovyâ€™s each{} iteration mechanism, you can put the closure outside the closing parentheses, and even omit the parentheses:

list.each( { println it } )
list.each(){ println it }
list.each  { println it }


Always prefer the third form, which is more natural, as an empty pair of parentheses is just useless syntactical noise!

In some cases parentheses are required, such as when making nested method calls or when calling a method without parameters.

def foo(n) { n }
def bar() { 1 }

println foo 1 // won't work
def m = bar   // won't work
